    <br>
    <br> 
    This is Erika, Staff Member from Global Association for Blockchain and Cryptocurrency. We’ve noticed that you are still not voting for our GABC Online Election.
    <br>
    <br>
     The Online Voting is still open! You can now vote for your candidates you think best fits on that position. You can only vote one (1) for each position;
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Board of Trustees</li>
        <li>Global Board of Directors</li>
        <li>Regional Board of Directors</li>
        <li>Ambassador</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    To have access on the Voting System, here is your username and password, then login your account on this link : <a href="http://gabc-election.digimahouse.com/login">http://gabc-election.digimahouse.com/login</a>
